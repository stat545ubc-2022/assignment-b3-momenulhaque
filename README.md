# Assignment B3
## Shiny app to explore the life expectancy of people in different continents during 1952 to 2007

This app is part a part of assignment B3 in STAT 545B course. Among the two options, I prefered **Option B** to accomplish the assignment. Before jumping into the description of the app and data set, I would like to show you the app first. [Click here](https://mhmondol.shinyapps.io/Assignment_B3/?_ga=2.112089028.1718176381.1669418652-905595288.1668997978).

### Data set used and rationale
The data set can be found [here](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). Besides, it is convenient to use from **gapminder** R package. For each of 142 countries, the package provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007. The app will provide a graphical representation of summary statistics of life-expectancy in different situations. One can explore for a specific gdp range, for specific year, for specific continent as well. Even it permits to compare them. It addition, the app allows to download the graph and filtered data set.
